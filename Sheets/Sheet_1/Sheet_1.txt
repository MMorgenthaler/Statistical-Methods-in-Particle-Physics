a) TMath::Pi()
b) TH1F are histograms with one float per channel. TH1D are histograms with a double per channel.
Due to that you would use TH1F if 7 digit precision is enough and TH1D for 14 digit precision.
c) The underflow bin stores values that are below the range of the shown histogram and the overflow stores those which are above. The underflow bin has bin number 0 and the overflow bin has bin number bins+1 whereas bins is he amount of defined bins in the histogram. Via those bin numbers they are just as accessable as every other bin (e.g. GetBinContent(0) would give you the content of the underflow bin).

Rene Brun one of the founders of ROOT said that it isn't necessarily an acronym but is called such as it's the " "roots" for end-  users applications". A possible acronym would be "Rapid Object-Oriented Technology".
