\section*{Exercise 8.1}

Given a note on the possibility of combining results from ATLAS and CMS we have to answer the following ten questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How is the CL$_{\textrm{s}}$ method used for the search of the Higgs boson?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item What is the shape of a hypothetical Higgs boson signal?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item How is the test statistic constructed?

  \noindent The test statistic $\testStat$ was constructed as 
  
  \begin{equation}
      \testStat = -2 \cdot \textrm{ln} \left(\frac{\mathcal{L}\left(\textrm{data}|\mu, \hat{\theta}_{\mu}\right)}{\mathcal{L}\left(\textrm{data}|\hat{\mu}, \hat{\theta}\right)}\right), \quad \textrm{with} \quad 0 \leq \hat{\mu} \leq \mu.
  \end{equation}
	
	\noindent $\mathcal{L}$ is as always the Likelihood and data refers to real observations or toy datasets. 
	$\mu$ is a \textit{signal strength modifier} which is applied to the SM Higgs boson cross sections. 
	A hat over the variable signals them the be likelihood estimators. 
	Therefore $\hat{\Theta}_{\mu}$ is the estimator given $\mu$. 
	The pair $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ are together the global maximum of the Likelihood function. 
	$\hat{\mu}$ has to be bigger than zero as the signal is positive. 

  \item How is the p-value converted to the significance?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item Why is the look-elsewhere effect relevant and how was it estimated?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item Why does the analysis introduce nuisance parameters and how many of them are there for ATLAS and CMS?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item Which shape do these nuisance parameters have?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item How is the starting point of the Higgs boson mass chosen?

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item Explain what figures 8, 9 and 10 represent.

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.

  \item Explain how the likelihood of equation 20 is constructed.

  \noindent Put very nice answer here.
\end{enumerate}
